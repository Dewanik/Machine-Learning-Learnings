# Multilayer Perceptron Based Color Predictor
A more playful practice for getting more mathematical intuition of multi layer perceptron building a Color Predictor that predicts
which colours suits the best for a rgb background.
Interactions made using pygame and Neural Networks built using the small libary made using only numpy also a rough version of the NN is 
there on MLP_from_scratch (https://github.com/Dewanik/MLP_From_Scratch) which gave me encouragment for this small playfull practice üòç.

This Practice Project is a product of inspirations and intuitions gained from :
Siraj Raval ,
Jabrils  and 
The Coding Train
