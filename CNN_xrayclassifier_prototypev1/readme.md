# A practice on Convolutional Neural Network Artitechture 
Creating a CNN model using Keras to classify whether a person is suffering from Pneumonia or not along with types of cause of the Pneumonia (Bacteria or Virus)

This really created a lot of intuitions on my way of exploring  one of most popular Artitechture of ANN the 'CNNs'
a better version and this time with web app integration will be the next self project challenge  and also welcome all of you on that project
